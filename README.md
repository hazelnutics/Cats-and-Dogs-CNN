# Cats-and-Dogs-CNN
The project titled Image processing using Convolutional Neural Network focuses on classifying images of Cats and Dogs in their respective classes. The project is developed in Python using various packages such as tflearn, numpy, opencv etc.
A grayscale image serves as input to the convolutional network which is processed based on various filters and the class (whether the image is of a cat or a dog) is given as output.
The data set is taken from Kaggle Cats and Dogs Redux.
24000 labelled images were used to train the network.
1000 labelled images were used to test the network.
12500 unlabelled images output was recorded.
